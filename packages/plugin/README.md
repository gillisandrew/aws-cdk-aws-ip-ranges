# EXPERIMENTAL: AWS IP Ranges Context Provider Plugin

This is an experimental plugin to dynamically fetch and filter the
published IP ranges for AWS services within a CDK app.

It is based off the example specified in the comments of the [plugins API](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/16d293d028b491743a9b6520086181efc1e00193/packages/aws-cdk/lib/api/plugin/plugin.ts#L114)
